### Is it worth it?

Yes videos are super awesome for beginners. Although it assumes that you have some previous knowledge of programming. Its fine if you are not familiar with Java. But some previous experience with programming is must needed.


### What are the functionalities in the app that has been covered?

* Fetching and posting tweets from Yamba Server, which is same as twitter.
* Storing the tweets in the database and fetching from it.
* A background process which keeps running to fetch new tweets from the server.
* Manual Refresh option.

### How this code is organised?

I tried to keep 1 commit for each episode but as I was beginner some commits are not running properly as I was looking for some help from a friend.


### Can I use this code?

Yes feel free to use it in any way you want to.



Happy Programming :)
